## üé¨ Demo Flow

### Opening (30 seconds)
**Say:** "I built this Dialogflow-powered compatibility chatbot to demonstrate my experience with conversational AI and explainable recommendation systems for Firstep's mission of intentional family planning."

**Show:** Open the demo at `localhost:5000`
- Point out the clean, professional interface
- Highlight the "Dialogflow Chatbot Demo" title
- Mention this was built specifically for the Firstep role

### Part 1: Conversational Onboarding (2 minutes)

**Say:** "Let me show you the conversational onboarding experience that collects user preferences through natural dialogue."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Start Onboarding Demo"
2. Type your name: "Alex"
3. Type age: "30"
4. Type location: "Seattle"

**Explain while typing:**
- "Notice how the bot maintains conversation context"
- "This uses Dialogflow's intent recognition and entity extraction"
- "Each response is processed by my Flask webhook backend"

**Continue the flow:**
5. For values questions, type: "5" (show 2-3 values)
6. For family goals: "biological children and shared parenting"
7. For communication: "collaborative"
8. For timeline: "1-3 years"

**Say:** "The system is collecting structured data through natural conversation, building a comprehensive user profile for matching."

### Part 2: Matching Algorithm (1.5 minutes)

**Say:** "Now let's see the rule-based compatibility engine in action."

**Actions:**
1. Type "yes, find my matches" when prompted
2. Show the results appearing

**Explain the results:**
- "The algorithm found 3 matches with different compatibility scores"
- "Notice how each match shows percentage compatibility and reasoning"
- "This demonstrates the explainable AI approach"

**Point out specific details:**
- "Sarah at 87% - strong alignment across multiple dimensions"
- "Michael at 73% - good compatibility with some differences"
- "Jessica at 64% - moderate compatibility with considerations"

### Part 3: Explainable AI (2 minutes)

**Say:** "The key differentiator is explainable AI - users understand exactly why matches were recommended."

**Actions:**
1. Type "explain the first match" or similar
2. Show the detailed explanation

**Walk through the explanation:**
- "Overall assessment gives context"
- "Strengths section highlights what works well"
- "Detailed breakdown shows scoring by dimension"
- "Next steps provide actionable recommendations"

**Technical highlight:**
- "Values compatibility: 87% because similar life priorities"
- "Goals alignment: 92% for shared family vision"
- "Communication: 78% for complementary styles"
- "Timeline: 85% for aligned timing"

### Part 4: Technical Architecture (1 minute)

**Say:** "Let me show you the technical implementation."

**Switch to code (backend folder):**
1. Open `matching.py` briefly
   - "Rule-based compatibility algorithms"
   - "Weighted scoring system"
   - "Transparent calculation methods"

2. Open `explain.py` briefly
   - "Explainability engine"
   - "Human-readable explanations"
   - "Trust-building for sensitive decisions"

3. Show `app.py` Flask webhook
   - "Dialogflow integration"
   - "Intent routing and processing"
   - "Session management"

### Closing (30 seconds)

**Say:** "This demo addresses Firstep's core needs: values-based matching with explainable AI through conversational interfaces."

**Key points to emphasize:**
- "Built with Dialogflow for natural language processing"
- "Rule-based recommendation system with transparent logic"
- "Explainable AI critical for family planning trust"
- "Production-ready architecture with Flask backend"
- "Demonstrates both technical skills and domain understanding"

## üéØ Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How would this scale in production?**
A: "Replace in-memory storage with database, add authentication, implement caching for frequently accessed profiles, and use machine learning to refine rule-based logic over time."

**Q: How does this handle edge cases?**
A: "Default values for missing data, compatibility thresholds for minimum match quality, and fallback explanations when specific reasoning isn't available."

**Q: What about privacy and sensitive data?**
A: "Data encryption, minimal collection principles, transparent data usage explanations, and user control over profile visibility and sharing."

**Q: How would you improve the matching algorithm?**
A: "Hybrid approach combining rule-based logic with machine learning, continuous learning from user feedback, and A/B testing of different weighting schemes."
