# Values Compatibility Matrix
# 
# This CSV file contains a correlation matrix showing how compatible different
# core values are with each other. Scores range from 0.0 to 1.0, where:
# - 1.0 = Perfect compatibility (identical or highly complementary values)
# - 0.7+ = High compatibility (values that work well together)
# - 0.5-0.7 = Moderate compatibility (some alignment possible)
# - <0.5 = Lower compatibility (potential conflicts or different priorities)
#
# Usage: This matrix could be used for advanced compatibility calculations
# that consider not just individual value scores, but how different value
# combinations interact with each other.
#
# Format: Each row represents a value, each column represents another value
# The intersection shows their compatibility score.
